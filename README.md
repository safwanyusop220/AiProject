# SMART AIR COOLING USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENT 

## A. PROJECT SUMMARY

**Smart Air Cooling:** Person/Moving Detection using Deep Learning

**Team Members:** 
- Mohammad Syafiq Bin Enchek Muda 	(B031910178)
- Abdillah Safwan Bin Yusop 		(B031910120)
- Muhammad Ridhwan Bin Razalee 		(B031910197)
- Farid Hazeeq Bin Burhanuddin 		(B031910427)


- [ ] **Objectives:**
The objective for this project are mainly for
- Reduce amount of workload needed to adjust fan position
- Create a small portable cooling fan just like a mini air-conditioner
- The fan will automatically target person/moving object using a camera.
- Increase efficiency of the power and air-cold as normal fan will only blow in static or sometime it rotate when there is no person standing there.  


##  B. ABSTRACT 

Currently the temperature in Malaysia now are soaring high as the weather in today world are increasing rapidly from time to time. This become major problem for Malaysia and also to those nation in the earth equator line (Khatulistiwa). Highest recorded temperature in malaysia are 36.4 degree celcius on February 2021, potentially making the coming weeks blistering hot. Moreover, based on the news taken from TheStar and BHarian, MetMalaysia director-general Jailan Simon said the country is currently in the last phase of the northeast monsoon season that will last until mid-March.

During this period, he said, rainfall is expected to be low in Peninsular Malaysia, particularly in the northern region. Those people who working on air-conditioner place will not have much trouble of ii but what happen to the people that dont have air-conditioner at the work place. As we know, heat place may reduce our energy to work efficently, especially during this MCO time due to Covid-19 happen on 2021 now, where most people work at home and which is most poeple dont have air-conditioner like their office.

Due to that, our team decide to make a Smart Air Cooling to solve this problem. Of course, we know that there a lot of product out there selling the air cooling fan. But this is not a normal type air cooler. It is a smart air cooler which user AI technology to automatically blow cool air toward the person. The Idea is to make a fan with servo to automatically targeting the nearest person posibble based on AI movement tracking or Person tracking depending on situation.

This is a small project that combining IoT and AI together to make a small scale air cooling which automatically blow the cold air toward the target user.
